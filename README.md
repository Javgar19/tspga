### Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms in an interactive and visual way.

This projects implements a simple web page where the user can add locations to a map to solve the TSP on them. The data is handled with Python in the backend (Flask) where Genetic Algorithms try to find an optimal solution.
